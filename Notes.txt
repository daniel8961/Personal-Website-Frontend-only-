Project ideas:
1. 3-leg chair {
    Idea (brain-storm) {
        Why: i want to lessen the legs used in the chair, 
        1 in front, 2 in the back. Because it'd provide more leg room to swing my legs.
        Look: curvy legs for appealing issue
        Material: apparent & prob acylic, or wood
    },
    Concept Development (3D Modeling) {

}
2. ergonomic keyboard {
    Idea (brain-storm) {
        Why: the traditional mouse hurt my wrists a lot so i switched to ergonomic mouse and it eased the pain.
        The regular keyboard hurt a lot too. Based on the current ergonomic mouse design, I plan to make a 
        keyboard that look like i'm holding the mouse on each of my hand. Left hand holds one and right hand holds the other,
        while the two are connected together.
        Look: 2 symmetrial ergonomic mouse
        Material: PVC
        
    },
