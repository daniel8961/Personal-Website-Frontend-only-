                <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                <p>My name is Daniel (Tsung Ti) Lee. Graduated with a Bachelor in Computer Science. I specialize in Web SPA (Single Page Application) using React.js. Currently working as System Administrator in Atlanta, GA.</p>
                <p>I am currently exploring my interests in other fields, with a strong passion for 3D Design. I enjoy designing practical items for daily life to improve convenience and optimize room space usage, especially in limited areas. My self-taught journey has enabled me to create efficient designs that maximize space. I aspire to make my designs attractive and inspiring to others, encouraging them to pursue their own creative ideas and dreams.</p>
