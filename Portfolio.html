                            This is my portfolio. You can see my interests and the learning progress in the following. 
                            Just started learning 3D drawing using TinkerCAD. Planning on printing 
                            the RC Car chassis using 3D printing.

                        <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                        <p>
                            I am Daniel the Potato. Couch is my workspace and it's where I come up with great ideas.
                            I graduated with a Bachelor in Computer Science, although I don't think this degree help me much with my life.
                            I specialize in Web SPA (Single Page Application) using React.js. Currently working as System Administrator
                            in Atlanta, GA. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am currently exploring my interests in other fields. I used to have a strong interests
                            in Mechatronics but never really learned what it's doing. I hope I can make a RC car completely
                            from scratch using 3D printing.

                        <p>
                            I wanted to place my phone on the desktop that's easy to check messages, and able to 
                            charge in the meanwhile.

                        <p>When I took it off from the printer, I tried too hard to rip off the support material that makes the 
                            stand (the two long stick) a little crooked. The cable locator (semicircle) was supposed to let the phone charging cable
                            stuck in there but I didn't design it well.

                        <p>I wanted to save space LOL so it won't be a mess on the desk</p>

                        <p>This Hanger is NOT flexible. It only fits the current Desk I'm using. Whenever i take the headphones off from the hanger, it'll shift away from the table. 
                            I'll have to move it back which is a bit annoying. Will make an updated version
